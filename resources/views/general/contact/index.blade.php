                <p>At Website.com, we believe everyone deserves to have a website or online store. Innovation and
                    simplicity
                    makes us happy: our goal is to remove any technical or financial barriers that can prevent business
                    owners
                    from making their own website. We're excited to help you on your journey!</p>
